metaDescription: 'Send your security data from third party applications, APM agents, or through our security data API.'
---

There are three ways to import common vulnerabilitie and exposure (CVE) data:

- **APM agents**: automatically detect CVEs in the libraries used by your service.
- **Third party integrations**: report CVEs detected by third party integrations such as Dependabot or Snyk. 
- **Our security data API**: report CVE data from unsupported third parties or your own solution directly to New Relic through our security API.

## APM agents

[Our APM agents](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm/) automatically detect CVEs. CVE detection is available for:
- Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby,: All currently supported agent versions. 
- Python: Agent version 8.0 or higher
- Ruby: 3.20.0

Support .Net agents coming soon. 


## Third party integrations

Import data from your other security tools directly into New Relic. We currently support the following tools. If your tool isnâ€™t listed, send your security data through our [security data API](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/security-data-api).

## Security data API

Send data directly to New Relic through our security data API. Use this when a tool-specific integration doesn't exist or if sending payloads directly to New Relic works best for your workflow. Learn more [here](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/security-data-api).
